    "text": "Welcome to the workbook for the SA-TIED Geospatial Workshop. Over the course of this two-day introductory workshop, you will be introduced to the R programming language, learn how to make thematic maps, and execute basic spatial models. We will explore the following topics:\n\nFundamentals of using R for data analysis\nCreating basic maps using R\nQuantifying the degree of spatial dependence in a dataset\nIncorporating space into statistical models\n\n\n\n\nNo specific prerequisites, although familiarity with working with coding environments such a R, Python and Stata is recommended.\n\n\n\nThe schedule of this workshop is as follows:\n\n\n\nDay\nType\nTime\nTopic\n\n\n\n\n1\nLecture\n09h00-09h45\nR for Data Analysis\n\n\n1\nComputer tutorial\n10h00-12h00\nR for Data Analysis\n\n\n1\nLecture\n13h00-13h45\nR for Spatial Analysis\n\n\n1\nComputer tutorial\n14h00-16h00\nR for Spatial Analysis\n\n\n2\nLecture\n09h00-09h45\nSpatial Autocorrelation\n\n\n2\nComputer tutorial\n10h00-12h00\nSpatial Autocorrelation\n\n\n2\nLecture\n13h00-13h45\nSpatial Models\n\n\n2\nComputer tutorial\n14h00-16h00\nSpatial Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis workbook is created using the Quarto publishing system.

    "text": "R is a programming language originally designed for conducting statistical analysis and creating graphics. The major advantage of using R is that it is open source, can be used on any computer operating system, and is free for anyone to use and contribute to. Because of this, it has rapidly become the statistical language of choice for many academics and has a large user community with people constantly contributing new packages to carry out all manner of statistical, graphical, and importantly for us, geographical tasks.\nInstalling R takes a few relatively simple steps involving two pieces of software. First there is the R programme itself. Follow these steps to get it installed on your computer:\n\nNavigate in your browser to the download page: [Link]\nIf you use a Windows computer, click on Download R for Windows. Then click on base. Download and install R 4.4.x for Windows. If you use a Mac computer, click on Download R for macOS and download and install R-4.4.x.arm64.pkg for Apple silicon Macs and R-4.4.x.x86_64.pkg for older Intel-based Macs.\n\nThat is it! You now have successfully installed R onto your computer. To make working with R a little bit easier we also need to install something called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We will use RStudio Desktop:\n\nNavigate to the official webpage of RStudio: [Link]\nDownload and install RStudio Desktop on your computer (free version!)\n\nAfter this, start RStudio to see if the installation was successful and you should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The RStudio interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have installed R and RStudio, we need to customise R. Many useful R functions come in packages, these are free libraries of code written and made available by other R users. This includes packages specifically developed for data cleaning, data wrangling, visualisation, mapping, and spatial analysis. To save us some time, we will install all R packages that we will need for the workshop in one go. Start RStudio, and copy and paste the following code into the console window. You can execute the code by hitting Enter. Depending on your computer’s specifications and the internet connection, this may take a short while.\n\n\n\nR code\n\n# install packages\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"sf\", \"tmap\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Linux and macOS users who are new to working with spatial data in R, this installation of some of these libraries may fail since additional (non-R) libraries are required (which are automatically installed for Windows users). If this is the case, please refer to the information pages of the sf library for instructions."
